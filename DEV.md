# Logs, quotes, and feelings

- 5/21 17:00 | Finally (sort of) created dev environment & (sort of) firgured out IBM cloud GUI. Interview tomorrow afternoon with 澎湖七美國中輔導老師。
- 6/3 19:30 | IBM's styling library is top tier dog shit，真的頂級難用。First of all, importing library into sass makes compile time increased to around 10 seconds. Furthermore, wrong order of import crashes the code. It also has the same problem with any other library -- limiting flexibility, which is fatal for a highly interactive program. I think the lesson is one library never fits all, and I'll just take some time molding the ui myself.
- 6/6 21:30 | More complaints. Styling is so stupid because CSS doesn't exactly follow the logic it was designed for.
- 6/8 19:00 | Building UI element is so much faster with Figma design. Most UI component is Reactified!
- 6/11 4:30 | Dang typescript is fancy.
- 6/11 23:40| So it all started when I decided to use typescript for better dev-x, then problems starts emerging. Turns out create-react-app is super outdated, and there are version conflicts with the newest version of typescript. There are workarounds, but I think our project is still in an early enough stage to chagne a build tool. I decided to go for Vite. The migration surprisingly does not take too long. However, setting up test seems to be non-trivial, and I installed a bunch of packages while failing to get testing to work. Its unlikly that we will need testing (for now), so I removed the test related artifacts from CRA and the packages I installed along the way, and I hope we'll have a clean start if we really get to the testing phase. Overall, tons of learning, a bit of frustration, but do have a working environment that I'm comfortable with.
- 6/12 23:46 | Wow, I really did wrote a lot yesterday. Thank god no one is reading this (or are you?). Anyways, not having testing properly set up, even when we're not doing testing, feels int. So today I re-did the testing set up, and it was faster than I expected. Other than that, more UI stuff, connected with Redux, tried out AI autocompletion tool, went through internal debate on how a component should be structured... and that's all for today.
