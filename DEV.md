# Logs, quotes, and feelings

- 5/21 17:00 | Finally (sort of) created dev environment & (sort of) firgured out IBM cloud GUI. Interview tomorrow afternoon with 澎湖七美國中輔導老師。
- 6/3 19:30 | IBM's styling library is top tier dog shit，真的頂級難用。First of all, importing library into sass makes compile time increased to around 10 seconds. Furthermore, wrong order of import crashes the code. It also has the same problem with any other library -- limiting flexibility, which is fatal for a highly interactive program. I think the lesson is one library never fits all, and I'll just take some time molding the ui myself.
- 6/6 21:30 | More complaints. Styling is so stupid because CSS doesn't exactly follow the logic it was designed for.
